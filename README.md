# A-B_Testin

At its simplest, A/B testing is a method for comparing 2 versions of something against each other to discover which is the most successful. The something can be an image, a button, a headline, or beyond.

Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type, 'average bidding',
as an alternative to the existing bidding type called 'maximum bidding'.
One of our clients, Company_X, decided to test this new feature and
would like to do an A/B test to see if average bidding converts more than maximum bidding.
The A/B test has been going on for 1 month and Company_X is now
waiting for to analyze the results of this A/B test.
The ultimate success criterion for Company_X is Purchase.
Therefore, the focus should be on the Purchase metric for statistical testing.<br>

In this data set, which includes the website information of a company,
there is information such as the number of advertisements that users see
and click, as well as earnings information from here. There are two separate
data sets, the Control and Test group. These datasets are in separate sheets
of the ab_testing.xlsx excel. Maximum Bidding was applied to the control group
and Average Bidding was applied to the test group.
